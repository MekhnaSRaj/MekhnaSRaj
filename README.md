As a final-year BTech student specializing in Computer Science, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My academic journey at Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering has equipped me with a strong foundation in C,Java,Python, and I have consistently applied this knowledge through hands-on projects and internships.

During my studies, I have:

Developed A Chatbot that provides information about the services offered by Akshaya Centres if Kerala using Rag and Gemini pre trained model.
Completed internships at CDAC, where I worked on a project that predicts the outcome of Kerala Lok sabha election based on previous election results.
